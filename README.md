# ðŸŽ² Dicee

## About This Project

**Dicee** is a simple iOS app I developed as part of my learning journey through *The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp* by Angela Yu on Udemy. This project was one of my early exercises to grasp the fundamentals of iOS development using **Swift** and **UIKit**.

The app simulates the classic dice-rolling experience â€” whenever users are playing some boardgames that usually needs a couple of dices but doesn't really have the dices, then users can use **Dicee** and tap a button to roll the two dices, experiencing a fun and interactive Las Vegas-like experience.

## Project Objectives

This project was designed to help me understand key concepts in iOS development, particularly how to:

- Build interactive apps with real-time user input
- Use Swift for logic and UI updates
- Work with UIKit components and integrate them through Interface Builder

## What I Learned

Throughout the development of Dicee, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Cloning and setting up Xcode projects from GitHub
- Creating user interaction through buttons and device motion
- Connecting UI elements with code using **IBOutlets** and **IBActions**
- Navigating and editing code in Xcodeâ€™s code editor
- Writing meaningful code comments for clarity
- Understanding and using **variables**, **constants**, and **arrays** in Swift
- Debugging apps using the Xcode console
- Implementing **randomization** in Swift to simulate dice rolls

## Final Thoughts

Although simple, **Dicee** was a crucial milestone in my iOS development journey. It laid a solid foundation for building more complex applications in the future and marked the beginning of my portfolio as an iOS developer.
